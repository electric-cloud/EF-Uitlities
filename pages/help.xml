            <p>EF-Utilities is a collection of common procedures to help you with your deploy projects. Its inception was sparked by repetitive actions required during my Professional Services
                engagements. It has grown over the years to what it is now.

                <h3>Decommission Environments</h3>

                <p>This procedure will allow users to create a process step easily using the new utility procedure which will tearDown all the dynamically created environments. This procedure can work
                    in the context of either Pipeline or a Job (Process or Procedure).

                <h3>Create Schedule To Trigger Gate</h3>

                <p>This procedure will allow users to create a stage gate that is
                  triggered by a schedule. This idea is to prevent a stage to
                  start before a specific date and time.
